# Laser-Spectrometer-Interface-GUI

python-seabreeze spectroscopy and sensor library demo, written to provide a fast, synchromized and lightweight way to control Ocean Insights spectrometers (specifically the FLAME-T-VIS-NIR) sample and MicroJewel laser connected via USB. Designed as a proof of concept for python GUI controls for sample aquisition and processing.

# Requirements
Python: Version 3.7 (NOTE: matplotlib does not currently support python 3.8 and above)

matplotlib: version 3.2.0rc3 or higher

numpy: version 1.18.1 or higher

seabreeze: version 1.0.1 or higher

pyusb: version 1.0.2 or higher

# Sources
Code taken from Github user MGPSU's seabreeze demo laser-interface branch with edits to connect the laser GUI frontend with backend operations to operate the laser
